            <h3>About PKMC</h3>
            <p>
                Padmakanya Multiple Campus (PKMC) was established in 1951 (Aswin 2008 B.S.) as the first women’s campus
                of Nepal. Initially, its academic activities were brought into operation at the present location of
                Kanya School, Dillibazar. King Tribhuvan inaugurated the campus.
            </p>
            <p>
                The campus has five buildings: two for classrooms and administration, one for computer lab and
                e-library,
                one dormitory for 200 students, and one old hostel planned for BHM program. Other spaces accommodate
                cafeteria and dance section with theater and class facilities.
            </p>
            <p>
                The library requires expansion to meet academic needs with more books, journals, and e-library
                resources.
